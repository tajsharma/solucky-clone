                <p className='paragraph-message'>
                Sanjana Solanki, a Bay Area native & 2024 Business Administration
                graduate from San Jose State University, created <i>solucky</i> as a creative
                outlet. Her passions for fashion, film, organization, decoration, & 
                makeup, along with her South Asian heritage, consistently shape the 
                brand’s unique vision. Hobbies like thrifting, decorating, & photography 
                inspired her to create <i>solucky</i>, allowing her to showcase these interests
                & collaborate with some of the most dedicated & hardworking people she
                has ever met.

                <p className='paragraph-message'>
                Founded by Sanjana in August 2020, the brand draws its name from a cherished 
                childhood memory. Inspired by her father's endearing reference to their family
                as "so-lucky," the name "<i>solucky</i>" was chosen to reflect a personal connection
                & resonate as a catchy, memorable brand identity.

                <p className='paragraph-message'>
                Initially envisioned as a blog to share the Founder’s creative passions with
                loved ones, <i>solucky</i> took an unexpected turn just before its launch. Collaborating
                with close friends to offer limited-time items, the brand swiftly transformed into
                the multi-dimensional creative force it is today.
